(Updated 6/6/24)

To explore the patterns of ethnic collaboration among professors, the analysis utilized a combined dataset scraped from Google Scholar, consisting of 1,000 professors from the UC Berkeley dataset and 1,000 from the UCLA dataset 

- Refer to the `datasets` directory within this folder for the combined dataset
- Refer to the `GoogleScholarDatasets` directory located outside of this folder for all the Google Scholar datasets.

### Results:
The results reveal the percentage of collaborations each ethnic group has with the other.

### Discussion:
The data indicates a higher rate of intra-ethnic collaboration among White and Asian professors compared to inter-ethnic collaborations. This trend is less pronounced in smaller groups, such as Black and Other ethnicities, likely due to the smaller sample size and the colleges chosen.
